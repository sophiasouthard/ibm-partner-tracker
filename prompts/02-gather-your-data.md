# Prompt 02 — Gather and Format Your Data

**Mode:** IBM VAR Channel Strategist (or default Agent mode)  
**MCP tools needed:** None  
**When to run:** After Step 1. You should have your opportunity export, meeting log, email log,
quota, and contact list ready. See [`PREREQUISITES.md`](../PREREQUISITES.md) for what to prepare.

## Overview

This step has four sub-prompts — one for each data source. Run them in order.
Each produces a structured table you'll feed into the tracker-building prompt in Step 3.

## 2A — Format Your Opportunity Pipeline

```
I need to format my pipeline data for a partner tracker. Here is my raw opportunity data:

[PASTE YOUR CSV/EXCEL DATA OR TYPE IT OUT AS A TABLE]

For each opportunity, I need these fields:
- Opportunity ID (from Salesforce, or make one up if you don't have it — e.g. OPP-001)
- Opportunity name
- Account name
- Product (map to one of: IBM Bob, Confluent, watsonx Orchestrate, watsonx.data, watsonx.ai,
  Security, Renewal/Modernization, or Other)
- Status: Active / At Risk / Stalled / Active No Pay / Need Check
  - Active = progressing with committed next steps
  - At Risk = stalled or missing key milestones, competitor present, or seller disengaged
  - Stalled = no activity, no next steps
  - Active No Pay = real deal but you're not on the comp plan for this account
  - Need Check = you haven't verified this recently
- Dollar value (total $, not just your filtered share)
- Stage (Propose / Design / Qualify / Engage)
- Expected close date
- Opportunity owner (Technologent AE or IBM rep name)
- One-line note on current status

Also tell me:
- Which deals came from partner-sourced activity vs. IBM-sourced vs. event vs. inbound?
- Which deals have an active Technologent AE engaged? Which are being driven by IBM only?
- Are there any deals where you're not on the comp plan?

Format the output as a markdown table with all the fields above.

## 2B — Format Your Meeting Log

```
I need to format my meeting log for a partner tracker. Here is my raw meeting data:

[PASTE YOUR CALENDAR EXPORT OR TYPE OUT YOUR MEETINGS — date, title, attendees, outcome]

For each meeting, I need:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Meeting name
- Topic category: Bob / Confluent / Pipeline / Enablement / Event / Relationship / Marketing /
  Modernization / Security / watsonx
- Key attendees (first and last name, or role if name unknown)
- Type: Virtual or In Person
- One-sentence outcome or note

After formatting, tell me:
- How many meetings were customer-facing (included a named end-user customer) vs. partner-only?
- How many were enablement sessions? Did attendance grow or decline over time?
- Are there any meetings where a Technologent engineer or AE led something independently
  (without you running it)?
- Are there any meetings with no traceable commercial outcome — no opp created, no follow-up
  logged, no action item?

Format the output as a markdown table.
```

## 2C — Format Your Email Log

```
I need to format my email log for a partner tracker. Here are the key email threads I want to log:

[PASTE YOUR EMAIL THREAD SUMMARIES — date, subject, who it was with, what happened]

For each thread, I need:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Subject / thread name
- Topic: bob / confluent / watsonx / security / renewal / research / event / marketing / pipeline
- Key contacts (name and/or role)
- Direction: Outbound / Inbound / Thread (ongoing)
- One-sentence summary of what happened or what was delivered

After formatting, tell me:
- How many research reports or architecture assessments did I deliver? Did any of them produce
  a registered opportunity with an AE-owned follow-up?
- Are there threads where I sent something significant (report, demo invite, research) and there
  is no evidence of partner follow-through?
- Which inbound threads show genuine partner or customer interest without cold outreach?

Format as a markdown table.
```

## 2D — Format Your Contact List

```
I need to format my contact list for a partner tracker. Here are my key contacts at [PARTNER NAME]:

[PASTE YOUR CONTACT LIST — name, title, region, what you know about them]

For each contact, I need:
- Full name
- Title / role (be specific: Account Executive, Solutions Architect, CTO, VP Sales, etc.)
- Function: Technical or Sales or Sales Ops or Marketing Exec or Technical Exec or Business Dev
- Product focus (which IBM products are they associated with)
- Region (e.g. Northeast, Southwest, Southeast, Rockies, Global)
- Last touch (month + year)
- Engagement level: High / Med / Low
  - High = actively engaged, has shown up to sessions, owns pipeline, or is a named champion
  - Med = has been in meetings but hasn't taken independent action
  - Low = on paper but no real engagement
- Email (if you have it)
- One-line note

After formatting, tell me:
- Who are my top 3 champions — the people who are genuinely bought in?
- Who are the executives (CTO, VP Sales, RVP) and have they taken any independent IBM-related action?
- Are there any critical gaps — roles I haven't connected with who I should?

Format as a markdown table.
```

## What to do with the output

After running all four sub-prompts, you'll have four formatted markdown tables.
Keep them in a single Bob conversation thread — you'll paste all four into the Step 3 prompt.
